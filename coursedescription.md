# Course Description

This course is a general introduction to computer systems. You will learn how computers works at a basic but fundamental level and how this reflects to the programs that you write. We will cover topics from Machine architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and basic IT-Security. We will also introduce you to the C programming language, which will be used throughout the course.

Make sure that you read all the following carefully.

## Preparation for CompSys
CompSys have gotten a reputation of being both a hard and informative course. As you can see below (and the course description), we will cover a lot of different topics that conceptually are very different, in a short time. It is therefore important that you are ready for the course when we start in September, avoiding to fall behind during the first weeks.

We do not ask you to read ahead in the material. However, most of you are still inexperienced programmers and CompSys in very heavy on programming and program understanding. You need to think of programming as a _craft_, like playing an instrument. You have during the first year learned the basics of how it works. But if you lay it away over the summer (do not program for two months) you will lose much of these skills that you have gain over the first year.

<!-- We have therefore posted some [preparation exercises and reading](preparations/README.md) you can do over the summer. -->

It is also important that you have looked into the tools that are needed for the course, so we encourage you to look at the [Tools page](tools/README.md).

## Short on Course Structure
In the following is given a short overall description of the course. More details can be found further down.

### General outline
The general outline of CompSys will be the following:

 * Week 36-41: Machine architecture and introduction to C programming
 * Week 42: Fall break
 * Week 43-45: Operating systems
 * Week 46: No activities (reexam week)
 * Week 47-48: Operating systems cont.
 * Week 49-51: Computer networks
 * Week 52: Christmas vacation
 * Week 1-2: Computer networks cont. and encryption
 * Week 3: Exam preparation and question hour
 * Week 4: 4 hour written exam

### Teaching in Block 1 exam period
Be aware that CompSys is a semester course, which means that we will be teaching (including having normal exercise and assignments) throughout the exam period (weeks 44 and 45) of Block 1.

### Exam
The exam is a written 4-hour open-book exam and will be held on Wednesday Jan 22. Course syllabus is all reading material, including the assignments.
We will later publish example sets based on the previous exam iteration and further details on the exam procedure. It will be possible to get limited feedback on the exam performance afterwards.

### Exercises and Cafées
The course will have both class exercises and open café sessions. The class exercises fill focus on smaller exercises that will make you better understand material from the lectures, prepare you for the details of the assignments, or prepare you for the exam.

The café sessions will, on the other hand, mainly be your possibility to get help with the assignments. However, it will also be possible to ask about exercises and other material. Also different teachers will (mainly on Wednesdays) also be presents, so you can ask anything in an informal setting.

### Assignments and qualification for the exam
To qualify for the exam, a minimum number of points must be gained through the assignments. On purpose, to achieve this limit requires a basic understanding of the programming tasks of the assignments (including presentation of this though test and a report), but not a full understanding.

It is also important to note, that the main purpose of the assignment is _not_ to prepare you for the exam; that is what the exercise classes are for. The assignments will focus on larger implementations and the practical learning goals of the course. Some questions in the exam will relate to the assignments, but qualifying of the exam (and even fully solving the assignments) will not be enough preparation to pass the exam. You need to make the exercises and the best way is to come to the exercise classes.

## Study ambassadors
The second year study ambassadors will can help you find a find a groups, if you are missing one. They can also be the link to the study administration; if there is something you are in doubt about and feel better to ask a fellow student, they are available. One of them will always be available at the Friday cafées.

The study ambassadors are:

## Assignment

There are 8 assignment in total during the course with deadline roughly every second week with the following deadlines.

|                                   | Expected deadline   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| A0: Getting started with file(1)  | 06 Sep @ 16:00      |
| A1: file(1) - Unicode             | 20 Sep @ 16:00      |
| A2: Simulering of x86 subset      | 04 Oct @ 16:00      |
| A3: Program behaviour             | 25 Oct @ 16:00      |
| A4: Processes                     | 08 Nov @ 16:00      |
| A5: Concurrent Programming        | 29 Nov @ 16:00      |
| A6: Computer Networking - 1       | 13 Dec @ 16:00      |
| A7: Computer Networking - 2       | 10 Jan @ 16:00      |

The assignments will be graded with points from 0 to 4 and it is not possible to re-hand-in any of the assignments.

Assignments are made to be solved in groups of preferably three students, but groups of two active students will also do. We strongly encourage not to work alone. Groups cannot be larger than three students. Each Group must make their own solutions and cannot share implementations and report with other. You can discuss material and ideas.

### Feedback
Feedback to assignments will be given by TAs on the course. It will be given written and can be expected about two weeks after the hand-in. Feedback will focus on what could be approved in the assignment relating to both technical implementations, and report structure and material. The feedback may thus be useful for later assignment. Feedback will not give a direct justification of the evaluation in number of points.

We expect the correction of submissions to take about as long as a the submission (either one or two weeks).

### Hand-in
The system in Absalon for group hand-ins does not always work as intended; we are therefore working around this. When you hand-in your assignments you are also asked to give a `group.txt` file, that contain the KU-ids of all group members terminated with a line-break; and only this. No names or other messages. The content of `group.txt` could look like:

```
dlb838
mdt733
agy623

```

You should still only make one submission per group; not one for each member. Note, that this means that the submission in Absalon is then only registered with the student doing the hand-in. However, we consider (behind Absalon) all valid KU-ids in the `group.txt`.

When your TA has corrected your submission all members of the group will be given the evaluation (comments and points). If some of your group members have gotten the evaluation, but you are missing, please, contact the course responsible. This often comes from a missing KU-id in the group.txt file. It is there very important that _your report always contain both names and KU-ids of all group members_, as the report is then used for resolution.

## Exam qualification

To qualify for the exam you are required to achieve at least 50 % of the total number of points in the assignments. A0 and A1 is in total considered the same size as the following assignments: this means that points given in A0 is weighted 1/3 while A1 is weighted 2/3.

Furthermore, we will require that you show a reasonable understanding of all parts (ARK, OS, CN) of the course. This is firstly interpreted as achieving points at least 40 % points in each the of topics. To optimise your understanding of the course, and since all assignments are in the syllabus, we encourage you to work with and hand in all sets.

Mapping of topics to assignments:

|                      | A0 | A1 | A2 | A3 | A4 | A5 | A6 | A7 |
| ---------------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Machine architecture |    |    |  X |  X |    |    |    |    |
| Operating System     |    |    |    |    |  X |  X |    |    |
| Computer network     |    |    |    |    |    |    |  X |  X |

The rule about 40 % of points for assignments in each topic, is included to make sure that you will uphold the learning goals for the course. We will teach you about many different abstractions and you should learn something about all of them. Without this rule you could attend the exam without e.g. learning anything about computer networks by getting enough points in the beginning of the course. The 40 % is chosen as it should be "easier" than the general rule of 50 %; it will therefore be set to 3 of the possible 8 points.
